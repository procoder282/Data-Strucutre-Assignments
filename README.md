# ðŸ“˜ Data Structures â€“ Practice Codes in C++

This repository contains all the **Data Structures & Algorithms programs I practiced while learning C++**.  
It is not just a polished repo â€“ it also includes my **trial codes, fixes, and variations**, so I can track my learning journey ðŸš€.

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside?

- **Arrays** â†’ unique elements, reverse, min/max, etc.  
- **Strings** â†’ palindrome check, anagram, basic string handling.  
- **Linked List** â†’ insertion, deletion, task scheduler (linked list based).  
- **Stacks & Queues** â†’ array & linked list implementation.  
- **Sorting** â†’ selection sort, bubble sort, quick sort.  
- **Searching** â†’ linear search, binary search.  
- **Others** â†’ factorial, prime factors, leap year check, etc.
